Lightweight configuration Web UI and IPC coordination plugin for SAL host applications (.NET Framework 4.8 / .NET 8).

## Overview
Provides a self-hosted HTTP/HTTPS endpoint (default: 8180) exposing:
* Live inspection of loaded plugins (name, version, metadata)
* Grouped editable settings (with DisplayName, Description, DefaultValue, ReadOnly flags)
* Persistence of changed settings back to the host (saved per assembly)
* Push (web‑push) message dispatch to subscribed users

If multiple host processes run on the same machine the first process becomes the control host. Subsequent processes discover it and coordinate via a named pipe IPC channel, avoiding port collisions and enabling cross‑process plugin enumeration.

## Supported Frameworks
- **.NET Framework 4.8** (NamedPipes-based IPC [WCF support removed])
- **.NET 8 (net8.0-windows)** (NamedPipes-based IPC)

## Installation
To install the Configuration HTTP Plugin, follow these steps:
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/DKorablin/Plugin.ConfigurationHttp/releases)
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a desired location.
3. Use the provided [Flatbed.Dialog (Lite)](https://dkorablin.github.io/Flatbed-Dialog-Lite) executable or download one of the supported host applications:
	- [Flatbed.Dialog](https://dkorablin.github.io/Flatbed-Dialog)
	- [Flatbed.MDI](https://dkorablin.github.io/Flatbed-MDI)
	- [Flatbed.MDI (WPF)](https://dkorablin.github.io/Flatbed-MDI-Avalon)
	- [Flatbed.WorkerService](https://dkorablin.github.io/Flatbed-WorkerService)
4. Grant permission for the application to use the specified HTTP/HTTPS port (or run the application in the Administrative mode):
	- Open Command Prompt as Administrator
	- Run the following command, replacing `{hostUrl}` with your configured host URL (e.g., `https://+:8180/`):
	  ```
	  netsh http add urlacl url={hostUrl} user={Environment.UserDomainName}\\{Environment.UserName}
	  ```
5. To use HTTPS, ensure a valid SSL certificate is bound to the specified port. You can use the following command to bind a certificate:
	```
	netsh http add sslcert ipport=[ipAddress]:8180 certhash=[thumbprint] appid={d10da6bc-77fd-4ada-8b3f-b850023e59ae}
	```
6. Launch the host application and optionally set Users[] and AuthenticationSchemes.

## Architecture
* Plugin.cs – Entry point implementing IPlugin & IPluginSettings. Initializes and connects the ServiceFactory, which hosts both HTTP and IPC endpoints using a resolved host URL (supports token substitution for local IP).
* PluginSettings – Strongly typed configuration (authentication schemes, users list, host URL template, push keys, etc.). Handles runtime formatting (e.g., replacing {ip} template) and authentication checks.
* IPC Coordination – Provides cross-process communication using NamedPipes for both .NET Framework 4.8 and .NET 8. Enables process discovery, connection, graceful disconnect, and remote plugin enumeration.
* Controllers – Build serialized DTOs (e.g., SettingsResponse) for the browser UI. Reflection extracts property metadata/attributes; TimeSpan values normalized to invariant strings.
* Static HTML/JS – Single-page UI (Index.html) renders categories and settings, posts updates, supports collapsible groups, and provides basic error reporting.
* Tracing – Custom TraceSource and WebPushTraceListener unify plugin log output with host listeners; Start/Warning events for lifecycle and faults.

## Settings Model
Each plugin supplying `IPluginSettings` is inspected. Property metadata used:
* [DisplayName], [Description], [DefaultValue], [ReadOnly]
* Type conversion via TypeDescriptor (supports primitives, TimeSpan, nullable TimeSpan)
Edited values are validated through type converters then persisted: `host.Plugins.Settings(plugin).SaveAssemblyParameter(name,value)`.

## Authentication
PluginSettings.Authenticate(principal) enforces schemes and optional internal allow‑list (Users[]). Anonymous or None schemes bypass checks. Caller identity must be authenticated when a scheme requires it.

## IPC Coordination
Inter-process coordination is achieved via NamedPipes for both .NET Framework 4.8 and .NET 8.

The first process to start becomes the control host, while subsequent processes act as workers and connect to it. The coordination sequence is:
1. `CreateClientHost()` opens a local service (`PluginsIpcService`) and connects to the control host.
2. `Ping()` keeps the channel alive and gracefully handles pipe faults (e.g., error 232 – broken pipe).
3. `DisconnectControlHost()` closes channels and aborts the local host on faults.

Exclusive access to IPC resources is managed using `IpcSingleton` (mutex-based), ensuring only one process can perform certain actions at a time. The `PluginsIpcService` exposes methods for plugin enumeration and parameter updates across processes.

## Release & Packaging
GitHub Actions workflows:
* test.yml – Restore, test, build (unsigned) for PR validation.
* release.yml – Auto versioning, signed build, NuGet packaging, artifact signing, dependency injection, final per‑framework zip creation.
Packaging script (Build-ReleasePackage.ps1):
1. Fetch latest Flatbed.Dialog.Lite release.
2. Organize build output into /{framework}/Plugin.
3. Download matching dependency asset (redirect netstandard to net8.0‑windows asset when required).
4. Merge dependency files, produce versioned zip: {Solution}_v{Version}_{Framework}.zip.

## Developer Notes
* Host URL may contain a template constant (see `PluginSettings.Constants.TemplateIpAddr`) substituted with local IPv4.
* Add new settings by extending `PluginSettings`; mark with attributes for richer UI metadata.
* Trace: use Plugin.Trace.TraceEvent(type,id,message,...) for consistent output.
* Exceptions during property set are caught; inner exception message returned to UI.
* TimeSpan values: serialized invariant ("c" format) – ensure client supplies same format.

## Extensibility
* Add new controllers: follow existing pattern returning serializable POCO/DTO objects.
* Inject custom authentication: extend Authenticate or front the HTTP host with a reverse proxy terminating TLS + auth.
* Replace UI: serve alternative static assets or integrate Razor/SPA; keep contract of existing JSON endpoints.

## Security Considerations
* HTTPS recommended (register certificate; see AssemblyInfo comment for netsh binding sample).
* Limit Users[] and avoid Anonymous where sensitive configuration exists.
* Protect web‑push VAPID keys; stored in settings (trimmed on assignment).
* Named pipes are local only; still validate process IDs if adding privileged operations.
